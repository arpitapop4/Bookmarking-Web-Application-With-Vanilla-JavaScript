# Bookmarking-Web-Application-With-Vanilla-JavaScript
Bookmarking Web Application built using Vanilla JavaScript (No JS Libraries Used).

You can use the browser application as it is (temporarily - since it does not have a login and only relies on saving bookmarks in browser cache) or send a pull request to use it offline on your system.
Please don't forget to credit me though ;) for the work I put in while learning to build these examples!
